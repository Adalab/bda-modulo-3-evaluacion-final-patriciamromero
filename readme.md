# Evaluation mod III

This project was requested due to the evaluation of the Adalab bootcamp for module 3. In this module we've studied the EDA processes, Pandas methods, transformation and cleansing methods, visualisations, analysis, ETL and pipeline, and A/B testing. 

## Structure

To make the information clearer, each exercise has its own carpet with a py-file and a read-me containing the steps taken, the choices made and a brief explanation of the data.


## In detail

This repository explores the data provided by an imaginary customer of an airline company. An analysis and research has been carried out to observe the insights of their customers. 

Contains the following folders: 

- ab_testing: This contains the Python file with the code and a markdown (readme.md) with the main conclusions. 
- analysys: It contains the code that analyses the data to answer the questions raised. There is also a markdown with the explanation of this data and some recommendations for the next steps. 
- etl: sup folder with the files used for each step in the process (extract.py load.py transform_clean.py) load py does not contain any code, it is just an approximation of what steps might be included. In main.py there is the main code used for the etl. There is also a readme which gives further details on the process. 
- files: this folder contains two folders (in: the given csv, on: the csv obtained after transforming the data).
- workspace: contains three Jupyter notebooks used for training and practising each stage of the exercise. 

### Steps

1 - EDA & data cleansing

This was the first approach to the data provided by the client in order to detect errors, patterns, etc. and to give this data a proper structure to work with. 

The data was cleaned to make it easier to work with, aiming for a better understanding and analysis of the data in order to provide the client with the right conclusions. 


2 - Visualisation and conclusions

In this second stage, the questions raised by the client were answered and some additional and brief comments were added to help understand the information. 

Some considerations for future steps were made, as these could help the company to get to know its customers much better and to provide them with a better service, for example. 

3- A/B testing 

Finally, an A/B test was carried out to explore the level of education of the more frequent travellers and to see if there were any patterns or correlations between education and flights booked.
